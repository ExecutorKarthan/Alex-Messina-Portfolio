## Description
This is a portfolio page that I devised to showcase my work and provide an easy means for people to contact me professionally. I really learned a lot about flexboxes, specifically how they can be used as a series of nested containers to obtain ideal formatting. I learned how to add hoverable tooltips and that I can use images to create icon-based links instead of using text anchors. I also used this opportunity to learn how @media to create a responsive webpage that adjusted for user screen size changes.
