                        Hello! My name is Alex Messina and I am an inquisitive, life-long learner that enjoys exploring challenges.
                        I am a firm believer in honest self-reflection as a path to improvement and view criticism as an opportunity to engage in that 
                        self-reflection. I think that collaboration is the ideal tool to produce the best quality product as it allows for a larger body 
                        of knowledge and unique perspectives to be applied to the problem in question. 
                    </p>

                <div class= "row">
                    <p> I tend to spend my free time programming to help someone make a repetitive, tedious task doable faster. At the moment, I do not have much 
                        free time as I am currently working toward completing my Web Developer Boot Camp through Washington University - St. Louis. I have leveraged 
                        what I am learning to produce the projects that you see below, as well as more you can find on my GithHub page.

                                The user can then add their own reviews to movie in the database, add movies to review manually or query an API to add movies to review
                                in an automated fashion.
